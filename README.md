# VirtualTourist 
Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project

#### Summary 
This application was created specifically for Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree. Virtual Tourist app allows users specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums for each location. The locations and photo albums will be stored in Core Data.

The basic concept of this is app is to generate a collection of images of a particular location by defining it's latitude and longitude and saving them for the user using core data. The users can also generate a new collection of images and select, remove the ones that they do not want in their collection. The images are from Flickr generated by making network calls.
